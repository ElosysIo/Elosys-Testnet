# elosys-zkp

The core of the Elosys project is built on the knowledge of the Sapling API and its zero-knowledge proving mechanism. Elosys leverages the BLS12 curve. A significant portion of the codebase was initially derived from https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash. Any code that hasn't been forked is re-exported, making this the primary entry point for all associated code. There should be no librustzcash dependency in other crates.
